# [My Homesite](https://rapasi.ddns.net/)
# Overview
#### This repository contains the source code for my personal website project. The site is built using Django with PostgreSQL for database management, and the frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Components
- Scrape.py: This script interacts with the ECB API to download and save interest rates, which are displayed on the /interest_rates page.
- Economical_data: This directory contains all static files (HTML, CSS, etc.) as well as backend code for database migrations.
- Economics: Here you'll find the Django settings and URL route configurations.

# Note on Availability
#### If you can't reach the site, it usually means that my personal server is temporarily off. This should be uncommon (hopefully) but may happen if I'm away for an extended period.
